# Introduction

This repository aims to share the thought process when I was trying to solve leetcode problems.  Though we might not use the skills and knolwedge required by solving leetcode problem everyday, its a good practice for anyone who wants to get an offer from those big tech companies (to be honest, it's useless :unamused:).

I also invited my friend Shawn to contribute to this repository...
