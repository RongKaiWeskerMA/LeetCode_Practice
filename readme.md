# Introduction

This repository aims to share the thought process when I was trying to solve leetcode problems.  Though we might not use the skills and knolwedge required by solving leetcode problem everyday, its a good practice for anyone who wants to get an offer from those big tech companies (to be honest, it's useless :unamused:).

## Background
I also invited my friend [Shawn](https://github.com/shixiao913) (a passionate software engineer interested in deploying AI) to contribute to this repository. 

This repository currently is pretty messy since we are still graudally adding contents and we ultimiately would like to share around 250 solutions with our explanation (Though I personally got inspired a lot by the the solution from [neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/practice). I would definitely recommend people to follow the categroies there and use this repository as a recap notes).
